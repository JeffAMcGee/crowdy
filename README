There are some toy programs in the intake directory.  This is their usage:
    ./jsoncrawl.py ../../tests/infolabers.json|./tee.py tmp|./digits.py 1

To use this project, you will need to install several python modules:
    pip install -r reqs.pip

You will also need to install pylucene. There are mediocre instructions on the PyLucene website. Here's what I used for the Makefile in a Python 2.7 virtualenv
    PREFIX_PYTHON=$(HOME)/virtualenv/crowdy
    ANT=ant
    PYTHON=$(PREFIX_PYTHON)/bin/python
    JCC=$(PYTHON) -m jcc --shared --arch x86_64
    NUM_FILES=4
